# MY FIRST EVER HYPRLAND RICE
This setup was possible by taking help form lot of repos and guides. So I'd try to help as much as I can via my repo!
## Waybar

My Waybar has following modules
1. Clock and Hyprland Workspaces (hope you're not surprised ðŸ˜†)
2. Weather (you can update your location from config.jsonc. Look for appropriate line in the modules)
3. Drawer for volume and brightness & bluetooth and wifi.
   I am using Pavucontrol (I hope you have it already)
   Blueberry for bluetooth management (you can get it via yay -S blueberry)
   And nmtui script to manager my wifi
4. I am using Swaync as my notification manager. You can find the config I am using [here](https://github.com/elifouts/Dotfiles)
